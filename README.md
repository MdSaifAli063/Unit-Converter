## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option A: Open directly
- Double-click index.html
- Note: Some browsers restrict clipboard access on file:// URLs. If copy-to-clipboard doesn’t work, use a local server (Option B).

### Option B: Serve locally (recommended)
- Using Node (http-server):
  - npm install --global http-server
  - http-server -p 8080
  - Visit http://localhost:8080

- Using Python:
  - Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8080
  - Visit http://localhost:8080

## 🧭 Project Structure

- index.html — App markup
- style.css — Theme and layout
- script.js — Conversion logic, events, and persistence

No build tools required.

## 🕹️ Usage

- Type a number in either left or right input — conversion updates live
- Choose Category, Units, and Precision from the controls
- Click Swap to reverse direction
- Filter units via the search input to quickly find what you need
- Use Dark/Light toggle to switch themes

Keyboard hints:
- Tab/Shift+Tab to navigate
- Enter while focused on an input to select its contents
- Escape to dismiss native selects (browser-dependent)

## 🧠 How It Works

- All unit definitions live in script.js under the UNITS constant
- Linear units use a factor relative to a base unit
- Temperature is handled via toBase/fromBase functions for affine transforms

Example of a linear category:
```js
Length: {
  base: 'meter',
  units: {
    meter: { factor: 1, symbol: 'm', label: 'Meter (m)' },
    kilometer: { factor: 1000, symbol: 'km', label: 'Kilometer (km)' },
    // ...
  }
}



Example of a non-linear category (Temperature):

Temperature: {
  base: 'kelvin',
  units: {
    celsius: {
      toBase: (c) => c + 273.15,
      fromBase: (k) => k - 273.15,
      symbol: '°C',
      label: 'Celsius (°C)'
    },
    // ...
  }
}


🛠️ Customization

Add a new unit to an existing category
Open script.js
Find the category in UNITS
Add a new unit entry with factor, symbol, and label
Example:

Mass: {
  base: 'kilogram',
  units: {
    // existing...
    stone: { factor: 6.35029318, symbol: 'st', label: 'Stone (st)' }
  }
}


Add a new category
Add a new object with a base and units. Use factor or custom toBase/fromBase functions as needed.
Add labels and consistent symbols for a polished UI.
Theming
Toggle via the top-right button
Theme is persisted in localStorage (key: uc:theme)
Colors and spacing live in CSS variables at the top of style.css

🧪 Precision & Formatting

Precision control affects decimal places (0–10)
Large/small numbers may use scientific notation for readability
Inputs display plain numeric values; helper text shows localized formatting

🔒 Persistence

The following are saved in localStorage:

uc:category — last used category
uc:unitA, uc:unitB — last selected units on each side
uc:precision — decimal precision
uc:theme — dark or light

♿ Accessibility

Visible focus styles and large hit areas
ARIA labels for inputs and selects
Helper text uses aria-live="polite" for updates
Keyboard-first navigation supported

⚙️ Browser Support

Modern evergreen browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari)
Clipboard features may require HTTPS or localhost for full support
